<h1 align="center">Code Structures (Genomic Ladder Networks)</h1>

<b>Custom dependencies and code architectures for project usage are located here.</b>

Important code structures include language-dependent objects and data structures needed for Jupyter or production-based functionality.

Examples of relevant structures can include engines for preprocessing/processing data for the project's tutorialized notebooks or custom visualization algorithms using advanced frameworks like Plotly.
