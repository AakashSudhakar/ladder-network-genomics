<h1 align="center">Notebooks (Genomic Ladder Networks)</h1>

Tutorialized project notebooks for investigating ladder networks against genomic data live here.

Since this project primarily utilizes datasets that have already been curated and processed to external standards (and in order to maintain associated data integrity), this project presents only one key step of the data pipeline: predictive data modeling.

The _predictive data modeling_ notebook depicts machine learning and deep learning algorithm design and analysis.
